# ✋ Sign Language to Subtitle

This project uses **OpenCV**, **cvzone**, and a custom **TensorFlow/Keras model** to detect a single hand from a webcam feed and classify it into one of several common **ASL (American Sign Language)** words.
It runs entirely on your computer with real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time webcam hand detection using [cvzone HandTrackingModule](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone).
- Classification of 24 common ASL words with a trained **`.h5`** model.
- Live preview of:

  - **Camera Feed** – shows your hand in real time.
  - **Cropped Hand** – focused region of the detected hand.
  - **White Background** – normalized square image used for classification.

- Simple and lightweight Python implementation.

### 💡 Future Ideas

- Add multi-hand detection.
- Support continuous sign sentence recognition.
- Build a web interface (React/FastAPI or Streamlit) for deployment.
- Expand to other sign languages in Southeast Asia.
- Integrate with speech synthesis for real-time translation.
